        <h2>Description of the Game</h2>
        <p>The mission is to beat whoever is using Minecraft to destroy Roblox. In this case, the boss and the dragon are behind the potential destruction of Roblox all together. After playing a game of Phantom Forces, they raged after losing and enslaved Minecraft to fulfill their desire of destroying Roblox.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>We implemented a point system where one would gain points if he or she kills the boss and how long the player is killing them.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The randomness occurs when the ghosts and fireballs are spawning in different points of the top screen.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The difficulty of game increases after the boss's defeat where the dragon has more health and fireballs. It increases in difficulty after each boss by more health and obstacles.</p>
        <p>The game ends when the player beats both the boss and the dragon by decreasing their lives down to 0. The player loses by getting hit by the falling obstacles after a number of times.</p>

        <h2>Reflection Piece</h2>
        <p>My partner and I made this game because we thought it would be addicting as Everwing. Everwing really inspired us by its game style.</p>
        <p>Two successful points during the development of the game would have to be creating the homescreen and getting the the Roblox character to move with the mouse-pointer while decreasing the health of the Roblox bosses.</p>
        <p>However, the two obstacles in the development of the game was the 1-week time limit which challenged our use of our time and getting the flamethrower to decrease the health of the bosses. We overcame these obstacles by distributing the amount of work between us and searching up and learning the algorithm to decrease the bosses' health points.</p>
        <p>If we had more time, my partner and I would have bettered the visuals of the game and added more levels to our game. We would have added a better point and live system.</p>

        <h2>Algorithm</h2>
            <img src="Algorithm.JPG">
        <p>What makes this an algorithm is that it is a series of steps that allow the fire to be able to move in the front of the other sprites with the Roblox character rather than the Roblox character moving alone. This algorithm shapes the game since it allows the player to be able to damage the bosses by enabling his or her mousepointer to guide the fire with the character.</p>
        <h2>Notable Mention</h2>

        <p>This allows the fire to decrease the health of the boss.</p>
