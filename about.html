        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> Hi! I am Taylor. </p>
        <p> I love the movie,
        <i> Crazy Rich Asians. </i> What I love about the movie is that the song, "I Can't Help Falling In Love With You," matched the wedding scene perfectly. Even though it is like any other romantic film, I just could not help crying in this scene!</p>
        <p>Grade: 12</p>
        <p> What I am looking for in the future is to innovate and engineer society for better convenience and efficiency. <br>My goals in life are to be successful and be happy. I hope to one day live the life of a millionaire. <br>What I like to do for fun is to play 
        <i>League of Legends</i> and read books. My favorite thing about school is how friendly and open the people are, something I never experienced in middle school. I am heavily involved in Scouts<br> and high school swimming.</p>
